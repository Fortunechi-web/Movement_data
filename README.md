We have access to a wealth of information about day-to-day living in today's data-driven world, especially about fitness and health. Tracking steps, calories burned, and other fitness metrics has become a daily routine thanks to wearable technology and smartphone apps. However, I discovered that I was craving more than just the figures my fitness app displayed. It did tell me how far I walked or how many steps I took each day, but I was interested in learning more about the patterns in my movement and how they affected my general health.

At that point, I decided to examine my daily movement data using a more analytical approach. In addition to the basic assertion, I tried to provide answers to queries like: What is the pattern of actions performed over time? How many steps are taken about the distance? How are the calories burned on various days distributed? Do steps and calories burned have a relationship? I went on a data collection, visualization, and analysis journey thanks to these questions, and I came away with useful insights for streamlining my workout regimen.
